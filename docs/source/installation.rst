   Plugins menu.

2. At this time, this plugin is not registered in the official QGIS repository, 
therefore it is required to add its home repository CTU GeoForAll Lab for it 
to be visible in the list of plugins. In order to this to be done,
in ``Settings`` tab hit ``Add...`` button and type 
http://geo.fsv.cvut.cz/geoforall/qgis-plugins.xml to ``URL`` slot.

   Add home repository of the plugin.

.. note:: It is also required to tick ``Show also experimental
	  plugins`` since this plugin is distributed as
	  experimental. In future, the plugin will be published in the
	  official QGIS repository.
          

3. Search for ``Ground Radiation Monitoring`` plugin on the ``All`` or 
``Not installed`` tab. After selecting the plugin, hit ``Install plugin``
